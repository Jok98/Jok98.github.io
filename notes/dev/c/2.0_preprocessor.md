## Preprocessor

es. `# include <stdio.h>`

.h stands for header file

The preprocessor is a program that processes the source code before it is compiled.

It handles directives for including files, macro definitions, and conditional compilation.

Keywords : 
- `include` : includes the contents of a file
- `define` : defines a macro
- `ifdef` : checks if a macro is defined
- `ifndef` : checks if a macro is not defined
- `endif` : ends a conditional directive
